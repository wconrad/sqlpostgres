The "rdocfo" script will create XSL-FO output -- by default (i.e.,
with no command-line arguments) for the RDoc installation itself.
You need Saxon (the command "saxon" in your path), or you can hack
the script to use a different XSLT processor.

Assuming "saxon" works, just run:

  rdocfo

and you should end up with a file called "rdoc.fo".

You can also do "rdocfo --help" to see the options available; you can
use those options to use rdocfo more generally.
