Description: Advanced Postgres library for Ruby 1.8
 sqlpostgres is a wrapper around the venerable Ruby postgres
 library. sqlpostgres builds and executes insert, update and select
 statements. sqlpostgres statements are easier to read and maintain
 than raw SQL. Ruby data types are automatically converted to and from
 SQL data types, and results are returned as an array of hashes rather
 than an array of arrays.
