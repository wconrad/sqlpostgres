libsqlpostgres-ruby1.8 for Debian
----------------------

sqlpostgres is a wrapper around the venerable Ruby postgres
library. sqlpostgres builds and executes insert, update and select
statements. sqlpostgres statements are easier to read and maintain
than raw SQL. Ruby data types are automatically converted to and from
SQL data types, and results are returned as an array of hashes rather
than an array of arrays.
